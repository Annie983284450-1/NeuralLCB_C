In critical care settings, timely and accurate predictions can significantly impact patient outcomes, especially for conditions like sepsis, where early intervention is crucial. While the previous chapter addressed the challenge of algorithm selection using a gap-based bandit framework, this chapter tackles a fundamentally different problem: modeling patient-specific reward functions in a contextual multi-armed bandit setting. The goal is to leverage patient-specific clinical features to optimize decision-making under uncertainty.

To achieve this, we propose NeuroSep-CP-LCB, a novel integration of neural networks with contextual bandits and conformal prediction, tailored for early sepsis detection. Unlike the algorithm pool selection problem in the previous chapter, where the primary focus was identifying the most suitable pre-trained model for prediction tasks, this work directly models the reward function using a neural network, allowing for personalized and adaptive decision-making. Combining the representational power of neural networks with the robustness of conformal prediction intervals, this framework explicitly accounts for uncertainty in offline data distributions and provides actionable confidence bounds on predictions.
