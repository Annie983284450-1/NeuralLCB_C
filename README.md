In critical care settings, timely and accurate predictions can significantly impact patient outcomes, especially for conditions like sepsis, where early intervention is crucial. This study tackles a fundamentally different problem: modeling patient-specific reward functions in a contextual multi-armed bandit setting. The goal is to leverage patient-specific clinical features to optimize decision-making under uncertainty.

To achieve this, we propose NeuroSep-CP-LCB, a novel integration of neural networks with contextual bandits and conformal prediction, tailored for early sepsis detection. This work directly models the reward function using a neural network, allowing for personalized and adaptive decision-making. Combining the representational power of neural networks with the robustness of conformal prediction intervals, this framework explicitly accounts for uncertainty in offline data distributions and provides actionable confidence bounds on predictions.
